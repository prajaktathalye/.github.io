									<p>The world, isn't it just incredible? Everything, from the tiniest ladybug to the vastest ocean, seems to have a secret story. And as a kid, I was always determined to decode those secrets.</p>

										<p>Math was my first love. Numbers weren't just equations on a page for me; they were puzzles waiting to be cracked, each digit a clue to a bigger picture. I’ve spent last five years of my life working with numbers! (I have a bachelor's and master's degree in Mathematics (Hons.) ) Even as a little kid, I had this knack for analyzing things. I wanted to find meaning in everything, interpret what numbers were saying and understand the language of nature. It was all about finding stories, meaning, connections.</p>
										
										<p>And in case you're wondering, I haven't forgotten my roots! I've published two research papers, proving that my love for numbers extends beyond spreadsheets.</p>
										<p>And then, colors entered my life. I discovered the magic of painting the landscapes, especially those dreamy worlds of Studio Ghibli. Oh, did I mention I love painting? Yup, I'm that person with a brush in one hand and a palette in the other.  Every stroke held the beauty of the wind sighing through pines, the sunlight dancing on a waterfall, the quiet wisdom of a mountain.</p>
										
										<p>One day, these two worlds, numbers and colors, collided in the most unexpected way. I stumbled upon data analysis, and it was like finding the missing piece of my puzzle. Numbers weren't just cold figures anymore; they were vibrant brushstrokes painting a portrait of the world around us. With Python, SQL, Excel, Power Bi and Tableau, I could now analyze customer trends, movie magic, and yes, even the hidden depths of Ghibli characters!</p>
										
										<p>My math background gave me the analytical muscle memory and the problem-solving skills. It let me dissect data and find the hidden connections and patterns while my experience as a tutor and volunteer taught me to speak the language of people, not just spreadsheets. Because data deserves a voice, not just silence.
										And my artistic soul? It gave me the ability to see the bigger picture, the depth of meaning beyond the numbers. It makes me see the story, the humor, the life in every dataset.</p>
										
										<p>So, here I am, <b>Muskan Kashyap</b>, the data storyteller with an artistic soul. I'm on a mission to translate the whispers of numbers into actionable stories, to help businesses see the world through data's kaleidoscope. And along the way, maybe I can sprinkle some colors and witty insights.</p>
										
										<p>If you're looking for a data analyst who can crunch numbers, see the big picture, and tell a story with them, let's connect! I'm sure we'll have a fascinating conversation, full of hidden meanings and unexpected connections. </p>
